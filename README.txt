This is a proyect which uses the WHO Mortality DataBase to predict the number of deaths
in Colombia based on the sex and age group.

1. We downloaded and loaded the database in the main.py file
2. We filtered data related to Colombia
3. We have readed, formatted and cleaned to erease null values,
obtaining values in correct format to do mathmatical operations and
Seeing useful columns to train a model in future.
